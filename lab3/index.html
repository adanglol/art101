Within our File Structure we have a Directory that contains folders and files needed for this class. Which is our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files as well as images.

				<p class="content">Task 4 and 5 to summarize was to add screenshots to our index.html in our lab3 folder and for to test file locally to make sure it is working in the browser as intended there are no screenshot or documentation neceesary so did not include. Besides from that after testing the file locally and making sure everything work it was time to uploud or push or local repository and update it to our remote repository on Github Desktop. It shows us all our changes and is important for version control as well. You can see our screenshot.</p>
