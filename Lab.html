    				<br>
    				<p style="line-height:1.5">
    					Hello my name is Aaron Dangc. I am currently an incoming third year at UCSC.
    					I guess to start off with knowing more about me is where I am from.
    					I was born and raised in Merced,CA which is located in the Central Valley.
    					Growing up and being raised in Merced,CA I would say it is a generally small city.
    					The estimated population within Merced is about 80,000 people. Nothing really goes
    					on in the town of Merced but its with the people there that matter. I am grateful to
    					have all kinds of freinds and family growing up in Merced giving me a strong sense of
    					belonging and home. Also more about me is that I decided to go to UCSC to explore
    					different perspectives as well as deepening my education. Currently I am majoring
    					in a BA in AGPM (Art and Design: Games and Playable Media). So far my experience at
    					Santa Cruz has been a positive one. With learning a lot from classes as well as
    					meeting new friends and peers along the way. To also add Santa Cruz is such a
    					nice lovely city to go chill at the beach or go on a lovely hike on the campus of
    					UCSC. Things I like to do on my free time is playing games with friends, watching
    					anime, as well as going outside, and been finding fun in coding. The ability to
    					be able to make something that can help others in form of entertainment or functionality
    					has been making me strive to do so.
