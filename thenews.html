          <h1>Team Project in the works ! - Art 101</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="content">Working with a assigned group within my Art 101 class we will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a Website that is creative or tackles a useful problem in some way or form also we will be implementing API's in our Project which we will be able to add to our Portfolios after completing this project. Honest thoughts is that I am excited for this project and will probably help me build momentum into a web development carrer by learning skills for developing Websites.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="content">First We need to come up with some brainstorming ideas for project. So I created a Google Doc shown in the image.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="content">To also add I already have some ideas of what to make which ranges from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anime Review Website</li>
            <br>
            <li>Interactive Web Game</li>
            <br>
            <li>Food Review Website</li>
            <br>
            <li>Movie Review Website</li>
            <br>
            <li>Personal Wellness Website</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="content">The project will most likely be on my labs page and in the works that is where you should go if want to check it out!</p>

          <h1>Looping GIFS in PhotoShop - 2D Animation</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="content">This quarter I am taking Art 106O which is 2D animation. It is a bit of work but honestly I have been enjoying the class. For our Module 2 project we worked on making animated Looping Gifs based on lecture of the 12 principles of animation. We had to make 3 GIFS all representing a seperate principle. I am still new to animation but its exciting of what is more to come and create in the near future of this class and outside of the scope of this class!</p>
          <br>
          <p class="content">Within the class we used PhotoShop here are some things that I learned and Used in Photoshop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Static Layers</li>
            <br>
            <li>Video Layers</li>
