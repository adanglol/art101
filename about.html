          <h1>Anime</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="content">I guess you came here to see and know more about me. Besides from being a college student and working on UX design web development and game design I think we all have some hobbies. One of my hobbies that I like to do is watch anime. It is a relaxing way of enjoying my time and really getting immersed. Currently there is a new anime called Chainsawman and I am in love with the dog named Pochita. Which is like a chainsaw dog. But yeah the anime is so different and mysterious in a good way. I have watched anime for a while and yeah if have not watched anime reccomend you to try watching it maybe you will enjoy it who knows!</p>

          <h1>Games</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="content">Besides from anime another hobby that I like to do is play games. I have played a lot of games. Recently past year or so I have been into the Dark Soul Series. It is a truly challenging series but is filled with some of the best experiences in the gaming industry period. Also another game I have been playing is Overwatc 2 and League of Legends. Both are fun competitaive online games that requires skills and teamwork to be successful. The image on the right shows the game Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice. A soul game that takes place in Japan during Sengoku period. This is fight with final boss and is one of the most intense and best boss fight I have ever fought. Took me hours to do but was all worth it in the end. But games are another way of passing time and enjoying time you have.</p>

          <h1>Meeting New People</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="content">I guees to finally add besides from anime and games I have a bunch more hobbies. For example I like to go outside, try new places, travel whenever the chance but I think an important thing I enjoy doing is meeting new people. I think its important to meet new people and hear different perspectives from people from all places. I think hearing input from others whether good or bad can help inform decisions to make you a better person. I think life is all about perspectives. Its like a lens there are multiple lenses to view from and I think picking and choosing what you like to see is important for how you want to act and reflect. But this image was from last year as my Second Year at UCSC having new roomates in the apartmates. Honestly meeting them they were some of the chillest and coolest people. I do not think we had any issues and I learned more about them as they have about me. But yeah I would say I am a shy person and for those who are we have to try our best to put ourself out there little more so we can connect and make meaningful relationships with people. </p>
