				<h1>Task 1 : Edit your HTML</h1>
				<p>After setting up our file structure within our folders me and my partner then proceeded to start editing our index.html file within the folder of lab2 as well as writing "Hello World" in the header tag as well as some paragraph text. The image shows us the code we are editing in the text editor. It is important to understand our file structure as we will be using these files throughout the class.</p>

			<div class="col-three">
				<h1>Task 2 : Viewing Our File in Browser</h1>
				<p>Now that we edited our HTML file within lab2 it was now time to view it in our browser. To do this we located the file location and clicked to view it. There is also shortcut of using <code> [Alt + W] </code> which is part of view in browser package within Atom. The ability to view our HTML document is an important and powerful tool that will help us later down the line helping us with debugging as well as making sure everything looks good or is working as intended.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-four"><img src="img/image1.png" alt="View HTML"></img></div>


				<div class="col-five">
					<h1>Task 3 : Create a CSS File</h1>
					<p>After viewing our HTML document in the browser the next task was to create a CSS sheet and proceed to use it so we can actual style our HTML and make it look decent. The image shows our CSS sheet that we are linking as well as some changes being made to our HTML document by styling it. We use the <code>link</code> tag to do so. After linking our document we are now good to style it.</p>

					<div class="col-seven">
						<h1>Task 4 : Link CSS file from our HTML</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="col-eight"><img src="img/image7.png" alt="Linked sheet to HTML"></div>


					<div class="col-nine">
						<h1>Task 5 : Inspect HTML Document</h1>
						<p>After linking our CSS file the next task in line was to inspect our document. The inspect tool is really powerful for web development as it has many features. To first note it is useful to be able to view all the HTML content on our page and also see what styles are present. It also helps if styles are not present or something not working to troubleshoot. So overall being familiar with Google chrome developer tool important to help fix and understand your webpage.</p>

					<div class="col-ten"><img src="img/image8.png" alt="Inspect HTML"></div>

					<div class="col-eleven">
						<h1>Task Bonus : Showing Off</h1>
						<p>After finishing up linking and styling as well as inspecting our HTML code and CSS it is time to show off. This is my partner Micah's website so far. Looks better than a bare HTML file.</p>
